# UCSE CSE131

My solutions to the projects for CSE 131 at UCSD, Spring 2023.

The directory `compiler` contains the compiler which I continued to iterate on
after assignment 4, as after this point it made more sense to continuously
modify my prior submissino, rather than creating a new submission for each
assignment.
